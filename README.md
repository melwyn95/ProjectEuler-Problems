# ProjectEuler-Problems
1. Longest Collatz Sequence
2. Largest Prime Factor
3. Prime Summations
4. XORDecryption
5. Multiples of 3 and 5
6. Special Pythagorean triplet
7. Summation Of Primes (Used Seive of Eratosthenes)
8. Digit Factorial Chain (Finally Long wait over Solved it memoization DP)(Planning to rewrite it in Java)
9. Maximum Path Sum 1 (Took Help From Discussion)(Very Important and Interesting Problem uses concept of BFS)
10. Highly divisible triangular number (Trick to this problem was to find the number of factors a number has we have to multiply the powers of its prime factors + 1 e.g. (p+1)(q+1)(r+1))
11. Pandigital Prime (Generated permuations of digits!!!! :))
12. Largest product in a grid
13. Coded triangle numbers
14. Pentagon Numbers (use property of pentagonal numbers i.e. n=(sqrt(1+24*x)+1)/6 is natural number)
15. Truncatable primes (very un-optimized NEED TO OPTIMIZE SOLUTION)
16. Non-abundant sums
17. N-Digit Fibonacci Number
18. Goldbach's other conjecture
19. Amicable Numbers
20. Prime power triples
21. Circular Primes
22. Quadratic Primes
23. Lexicographic Permutations
