# ProjectEuler-Problems
1. Longest Collatz Sequence
2. Largest Prime Factor
3. Prime Summations
4. XORDecryption
5. Multiples of 3 and 5
6. Special Pythagorean triplet
7. Summation Of Primes (Used Seive of Eratosthenes)
8. Digit Factorial Chain (Re-Working on the problem hope to solve it on weekend)
9. Maximum Path Sum 1 (Took Help From Discussion)(Very Important and Interesting Problem uses concept of BFS)
10. Highly divisible triangular number (Trick to this problem was to find the number of factors a number has we have to multiply the powers of its prime factors + 1 e.g. (p+1)(q+1)(r+1))
11. Pandigital Prime (Generated permuations of digits!!!! :))
12. Largest product in a grid
